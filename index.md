**Role:** Programmer  
**Genre:** Card game/Turn-based Strategy  
Place cards on the board to capture and control as many cards as possible, without letting your opponent take them back. Use special abilities to control the board and ensure victory.  

## Untitled Shoot'em Up Project

**Role:** Solo development  
**Genre:** Shoot'em Up  
Solo project I planned on working on in between jobs. Did the 3D modelling and player/camera controls before I had to shelve the project.

## My Guild Life

**Role:** Lead Designer, Lead Programmer  
**Genre:** Turn-based RPG/Puzzle  
Use your party's skills to move enemies around the board in order to defeat them efficiently. The faster you complete the encounter, the better the score. Higher scores yield more resources to invest in your adventurer's guild. This project has been shelved due to lack of funding, but I'd love to return to it one day.

**Role:**  Programmer  
**Genre:** Sidescroller Action  
My Global Game Jam 2017 entry. Theme was "Waves". As a blind samurai spirit, use the sound of your sword hitting the sheath to see your surroundings and repel evil spirits trying to attack the meditating monk, but beware, as the sound makes the spirits angry and causes them to move faster.
